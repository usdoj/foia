# DOJ FOIA Project

The DOJ FOIA project's larger purpose is to create a single, unified portal for the submission of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.  This code base's part in that larger goal is to create a Drupal backend which will be accessed by a front-end being developed by [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov).

The backend is currently implemented on the [Lightning distro](https://github.com/acquia/lightning), stealing numerous approaches/configurations from the [Reservoir project](https://github.com/acquia/reservoir)

## BLT

Please see the [BLT documentation](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for information on build, testing, and deployment processes.

### Local setup

Follow steps 1-6 from the [initial setup section](https://blt.readthedocs.io/en/8.x/readme/onboarding/#initial-setup) in BLT's docs, as well as 1-3 from the VM steps. Note that you do not need to follow the steps to install npm/nvm on your host machine. If we end up working frontend tasks, these steps can take place within the VM.
VM-related software version suggestions:
Virtualbox - 5.1.24
Vagrant - 1.9.7
Ansible - 2.2.3
